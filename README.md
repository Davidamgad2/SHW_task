Thanks for this opportuinty!

Kindly please note that I have ignored the venv that I'm working with. I use python 3.10.6

Please also note that the authorization header will be like the task that has been sent with email

key=Authorization
value=bearer SHEBAK@2022

Also the excel file that will be generated will have the count number of each quote inside the 100, but after that if we call the one of the quote that has been called during the first 100 again the second 100 it will not countinue with the values in the first 100 (I hope I made my point clear :D)

Regarding the GUI

Random_quote.exe will be the windows application but we need to run the server first. also I handled this error that when you press the button nothing will happens

I used app inventor which is drag and drop to make the mobile application (Task.apk)
to use this app please run django server on 0.0.0.0:8000 and to use the app please write the ip of the pc that the server is working on in the first text box 

source code for the mobile application and the desktop application in the folders, kindly please don't move the windows application from its place as the source code contains "windows/Design.ui" to load the ui so the windows desktop application.exe should be out side the windows_application dir

Best Regards!
